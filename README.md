# The Detroit Chapter of Papers We Love

This is the repository for the Detroit chapter of Papers We Love. As a local chapter we follow the Papers We Love [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/papers-we-love/detroit/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

### Information

Currently the Detroit chapter of Papers We Love is co-organized with the [Detroit Tech Watch](https://www.meetup.com/Detroit-Tech-Watch) meetup. The current plan (as of October 1, 2019) is to host a PWL meetup every quarter in place of the regular DTW meeting for that month.  

If there's sufficient interest we may set up a separate meetup or we may meet more often.
